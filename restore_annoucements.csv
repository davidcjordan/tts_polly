826,826Efficient_drill.WAV,Even though this shot is soft it can be thrown to different locations at a rate of one ball per second. This allows three players to efficiently drill at the same time while up to six players wait behind them for their turn. In one minute each kid has hit twenty balls. At the end of the drill I ask them to pick up twenty balls and put them back into my hopper before getting back in line. This lets the drill run continuously and frees up the tennis pro to teach from the student's side and occasionally jump into the drill to demonstrate proper form.
