801,801Boomer_demo_intro.WAV,My name is Boomer and I’m the world’s first tennis playing robot.  I’m a top of the line tennis ball machine coupled with two wireless cameras a wireless speaker and a computer.  My two cameras watch every ball you hit and calculate bounce position and speed. I am an expert tennis player with extraordinary hitting skills capable of playing or drilling at any level from beginner to professional. This workout is a collection of my most popular drills. Feel free to hit the balls back and get a score. At the end of this workout I invite you to play a game against me. Enjoy!
802,802Game_intro.WAV,When you play a game against me I rate each of your shots based on depth width and speed and then decide what type of shot to throw in reply. The type and difficulty of the shot I throw depends partly on my selected level and partly on the quality of your shot with some randomness built in to be unpredictable like a human opponent. I start each point at my selected level but adjust my level up or down based on the quality of your shots. If you are hitting shots deeper or wider or faster than me you are rewarded by me dropping my level slightly. Conversely if you are hitting weak shots I punish you by raising my level slightly. This is the equivalent of getting ahead or behind in the point against a human opponent. You can win a point with a single excellent shot like an ace or a hard hit return to the corner. You can also win a point by hitting two consecutive very good shots. You can also win a point by hitting three consecutive good shots. The last way to win a point is a prolonged grind where you consistently play above my selected level. You lose a point when you hit a shot out in the net or double fault. When the point is over I announce the score and then go back to my selected level. If we are in your service game I toss you balls to serve and tell you which court to serve too. If I’m serving I tell you which court I’m serving to. There is no way to game the system to beat me. To beat me you must play better than me by hitting the ball deeper or harder or closer to the lines. If you learn to beat me at a certain level that will allow you to beat a human opponent at that level. Since I can play at a professional level you are guaranteed to have a challenging match no matter how good you get. So far no one has beaten me at my highest level.
803,803Suicide_drill_intro.WAV,This is a six ball drill where you start at the baseline and then transition to the net after the third ball. Each ball has a target which is announced right after it is thrown. The target for the first two balls is deep cross court. The target for the third ball is deep line. The target for the fourth and fifth balls is to volley short cross court. The last ball is a lob and the target is an overhead anywhere in the singles court. I will announce your score at the end of the drill.
804,804Mini_tennis_intro.WAV,This is a mini tennis drill used for beginners or warmup. Each ball can be volleyed or hit after the bounce. The balls alternate between forehand and backhand.
805,805Easy_random_ground_intro.WAV,This is an easy version of my most popular groundstroke drill. The drill throws six balls to random positions in the court at a level below Boomer’s set level. The spin is also random forcing you to adjust to topspin and backspin. The target is the whole singles court but you get a higher score for hitting the ball harder deeper and wider without missing. The best way to improve your groundstrokes is to play each ball as if you were playing a game. That means hitting the best ball you can while limiting your errors. At the end I will announce your score and your average ball speed of the balls that landed in.
806,806Hard_random_ground_intro.WAV,This is a harder version of the random groundstroke drill. It is scored the same as the previous drill but the balls that I throw are at a level above Boomer’s set level.
807,807Easy_net_intro.WAV, This is an easy version of my most popular net drill. This drill tests your ability to move back to hit an overhead and move up to hit a volley. The first ball is a lob and your overhead is scored based mostly on speed and depth. The next two balls are random passing shots and the volleys are scored mostly on width and speed. Then this three ball pattern of lob and two passing shots is repeated twice. At the end I will announce your score.
808,808Hard_net_intro.WAV, This is a harder version of the net drill. It is scored the same as the previous drill but the balls are at a level above Boomer’s selected level.
809,809Beep_intro.WAV,This is a beep drill used to test your footspeed and consistency. The drill starts with a ball to the deuce court and then alternates to the ad court. The interval between the balls is reduced until you miss. The target is anywhere in the singles court but you get a higher score if you hit harder deeper or wider without missing.
810,810Play_game_intro.WAV,Boomer will go back to the main menu once this workout is over. I invite you to play a game against me by pressing the game button on the touchscreen. I show a game option screen where you can set my level anywhere between two point zero and seven point zero. You can also press the game help button and I will explain how to play a game against me.

The goal is to move forward diagonally to take the ball as early as possible and hit the volley deep to either corner.
824,824Boomer_short_intro.WAV,My name is Boomer and I'm the world's most advanced tennis robot. Like most modern high end ball machines I can throw a ball to any position of the court with any desired speed and spin.
825,825True_mini_tennis_shot.WAV,Here is a very soft shot suitable for little kids or total beginners. To clear the net I must be placed on the service line. Since I'm back on the baseline this ball will not clear the net.
826,826Efficient_drill.WAV,Even though this shot is soft it can be thrown to different locations at a rate of one ball per second. This allows three players to efficiently drill at the same time while up to six players wait behind them for their turn. In one minute each kid has hit twenty balls. At the end of the drill I ask them to pick up twenty balls and put them back into my hopper before getting back in line. This lets me to run continuously and frees up the tennis pro to teach from the student's side and occasionally jump into the drill to demonstrate proper form.
